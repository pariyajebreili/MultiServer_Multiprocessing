# MultiServer_Multiprocessing

# Brief summary of this project

the project uses the multiprocessing library to create five servers, and that the number of clients that each server can handle
is one.If more than five clients request to connect to the servers, they have to wait until one of the servers becomes available and then connect to it.

Socket programming has been used for communication between the server and clients.

The client-server design pattern has been used.
